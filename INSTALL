Requirements
============
 -- CMake 2.6.0 or later


Basic Installation
==================
These instructions give a very basic overview of how to configure, compile and
install ZZ_polynomial on most systems.  If you are using unique install locations please consult the 'Advanced' section.

1. Create a 'build' directory in the package source directory.

   mkdir build
   cd build

2. Configure the build system. You can specify additional build
options at this time (see below).

   cmake ../

3. Compile

   make

4. Test (optional)

   make test

5. Install

   sudo make install

6. To clean up, just remove the 'build' directory.


Advanced
========
The build system (CMake) provides mechanisms for specifying
non-standard installation locations and enabling/disabling of optional
components.

   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX : specify the installation prefix
                            (default /usr/local)


*** Without CMake ***

If you don't want to use CMake, just add all .cpp files to a makefile. yaml-cpp does not need any special build settings, so no 'configure' file is necessary.

(Note: this is pretty tedious. It's sooo much easier to use CMake.)
